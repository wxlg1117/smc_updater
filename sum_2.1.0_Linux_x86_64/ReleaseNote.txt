Supermicro Update Manager (SUM) Release Notes
================================================
Software Release Version: V2.1.0
Release Date: 2018/09/03


Introduction
============
The Supermicro Update Manager (SUM) can be used to manage the BIOS/BMC/CMM/PSU/
Broadcom 3108 RAID firmware image update and configuration update for select
systems. In addition, system checks as well as event log management are also
supported.
Moreover, special applications are also provided to facilitate system
management. To update configurations, users can edit system BIOS settings, DMI
information and BMC/RAID/CMM configurations from readable text files, as well as
use this update manager to apply these configurations.

Two channels are possible for management: the OOB (Out-Of-Band) channel, i.e.
communication through the BMC IPMI interface, and the in-band channel, i.e.
communication through the local system interfaces. By the OOB channel, most
management commands (except CheckSystemUtilization) can be executed
independently of the OS on the managed system and even before the system OS
is installed.

Known Limitation
================
1. In-band UpdateBmc command does not support AMI BMC FW.
2. OOB UpdateBios command does not support MBs that implemented client ME, such
   as X11SAE-F, X11SAT-F, X11SSZ-(Q)F/LN4F, X11SRM-VF and X11SBA-(LN4)F. And it
   does not support C7-series platform, either.
3. X9DRL-iF/3F MB does not support OOB BIOS update and OOB/in-Band DMI
   information related commands.
4. For the --reboot option in OOB usage, if the target OS does not support
   software shutdown, system will be forced to power off and on again.
5. With the Server ME embedded on the Supermicro system, the execution of the
   in-band command "UpdateBios" might fail when the Client ME driver (MEIx64)
   is installed on Windows.
6. All commands of CMM Management are for OOB use only.
7. In-band GetBmcCfg/ChangeBmcCfg commands in Windows does not support a
   hostname that exceeds 244 bytes.
8. ChangeBiosCfg command will show error messages if the current BIOS
   configuration is different from  the generated BIOS XML configuration file.
9. BIOS XML configuration REQUIRES a text editor supporting extended ASCII
   characters (ISO-8859-1 encoding).
10.The SW-managed JPME2 feature to update FDT in ME region is NOT supported in
   the following MBs: X11DDW-L/N(T) Revision 1.10, X11DPH-T-P Revision 1.00,
   X11DPL-I-P Revision 1.01, X11DPU-X(LL) of older versions and Revision 1.01.
   Note that the earlier revisions of those four MBs are not supported, either.
11.The TpmProvision command does not support TPM 2.0 on Grantley.
12.A1SRi/A1SAi MB does not support OOB BIOS update.
13.The TpmProvision command does not support on the platforms after Purley.
14.The UpdatePsu command only supports PSU "PWS-2K04A-1R" and "PWS-2K20A-1R".
15.The UpdatePsu command does not support multi-OOB usage.
16.In-Band UpdateBmc command on FreeBSD OS will be slow caused by KCS driver
   of FreeBSD.
17.Prevent BIOS downgrade if the ME version of current BIOS is between
   4.1.x.xxx and 4.0.4.294.
